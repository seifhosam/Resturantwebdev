<h1> About US </h1>
<h2> Since our modest beginnings in 2005 with a little space <br> 
     in Toronto’s  stylish Yorkville locale, Grand‘s<br> 
     development has been enlivened with the energy to cook <br> 
     and serve solid, Indian-roused takeout food. In contrast<br> 
     to other Indian eateries, Grand Resturant was made <br> 
     with the explicit expectation to appear as something else.<br> 
     We realize numerous individuals love Indian sustenance,<br> 
     yet a large number of them loathe or are unconscious <br> 
     of the regularly unfortunate fixings that make <br> 
     run-of-the-mill Indian nourishment taste so great.<br> 
     Our menu highlights things that utilization the sound and<br> 
     fragrant flavors, however, forgets the stuffing ghee, <br> 
     spread, oil, and overwhelming cream. Grand Resturant <br> 
     has developed to incorporate four superb takeout areas<br> 
     in Toronto with additional to come sooner rather than <br> 
     later. Our group takes pride in the way that we can <br> 
     furnish our new and faithful clients with extraordinary <br> 
     tasting Indian-roused nourishment that is not normal for <br> 
     that at some other Indian eatery you visit.</h2>
